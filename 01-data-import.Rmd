```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Cut and paste method

*We'll start by talking about this approach.*

Read in the data for three sites:
```{r}
gslook <- read_csv("data/GSLOOK.csv")
gsmack <- read_csv("data/GSMACK.csv")
gsws01 <- read_csv("data/GSWS01.csv")

# then figure out how to join them altogether,
# or keep repeating operations once for each site.
```

## Iteration method

*By the end of class, we'll have figured out, and will fix this approach.*

```{r}
streams <- tibble(
  file = c("data/GSLOOK.csv", "data/GSMACK.csv", "data/GSWS01.csv")
)
```

> For each row, apply `read_csv()` to the element inside of  `file`. Store the result in the `data` column.

```{r}
streams %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(data = read_csv(file))
```
